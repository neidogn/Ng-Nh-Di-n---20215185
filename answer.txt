 1.Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
 In Java, arguments are passed by value, not by reference. This means that when you pass a primitive data type or 
 an object to a method in Java, a copy of the value or reference is created and passed to the method. Any changes 
 made to the value or reference within the method do not affect the original value or reference outside the method.

However, it's important to note that when you pass an object to a method in Java, the value that is passed is actually
 a reference to the object in memory, not the object itself. This can sometimes lead to confusion because it can 
 appear as though objects are being passed by reference, but in reality, it is just the reference to the object that is 
 being passed by value.
